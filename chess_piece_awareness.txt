How does a piece know where it can go? (Later: where it wants to go)

A piece is only aware of the square it is on, and can "ask" questions to that square:
- what fields are reachable from here? (which square can "feel" me)
- (secondary:) what enemies are on reachable spots

The field the queen is on gets a request from the queen itself.
It passes that request on to N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W and NW.
Each of those squares passes the request on in the opposite direction, and so on until the boundary is reached.
Finally the last reachable square passes itself as an object back to the former, the former adds itself to that list, and so on.
