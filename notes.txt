TODO:
- have a physical chessboard on the table always!

- idea: add goToSleep as counterpart to wakeUp, to announce presence a.o.
- question: should we see the vibrations as coninuously present or as events?... 
- king and queen should inherit from piece (e.g. moveTo is generic)
- add function setPiece, refactor lines 129-139 (putting piece objects on the board)
- refactor determination of neighbours for squares
- CRC cards
