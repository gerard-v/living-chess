Notes
- At daybreak & nightfall: pass on vibrations, store in squares
- Vibrations are important not just on squares around you but also on the square where you are
- Friendly vibrations mean safety, or plus points, enemy vibrations are danger or minus points
- Strong pieces should be extra sensitive to enemy vibrations

- Question: should we see the vibrations as continuously present or as events?...
- refactor determination of neighbours for squares
- CRC cards

Long range vibrations hitting a king:
- should not stop, but propagate beyond the king (see stage.py line 106)

Idea for testing the changed way of propagating, passing ghost pawns (and kings):
Create a FEN with a rook on h3 and a single Pawn that can still move 2 squares forward,
somewhere in the middle, eg on e2 or g2.
