Notes
- At daybreak & nightfall: pass on vibrations, store in squares
- Vibrations are important not just on squares around you but also on the square where you are
- Friendly vibrations mean safety, or plus points, enemy vibrations are danger or minus points
- Strong pieces should be extra sensitive to enemy vibrations

- Question: should we see the vibrations as continuously present or as events?...
- refactor determination of neighbours for squares
- CRC cards
